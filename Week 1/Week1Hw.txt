On a computer there are two different ways to navigate. The most common is the graphical user interface or GUI for short. This is a graphic representation with menus, windows, and icons. This method lets you click around the menus and windows to navigate. The second method is the CLI or command-line interface. This is a text based representation of what is happening on the computer, with interaction done through entering commands. Both of these interfaces have their pros and cons, with CLI being harder to learn but faster, and GUI being easier to understand but not as complex.
