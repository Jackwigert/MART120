The last lecture video was an interesting lecture by an interesting person. Even though he doesn't have long to live he is still cheerful and healthy. The lecture is framed around how he has achieved his childhood dreams, and he offers lots of advice throughout it. The video made me feel sad seeing look back at his life now that it is coming to an end, but I found it somewhat inspiring that he was able to achieve his childhood dreams. I found it relatable how he owes so much of his life to learning from others. My favorite take away was that most of what we learn is indirect and accidental.
