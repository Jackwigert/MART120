Kinda stupid quiz. 
Auditory: 40%
Visual: 35%
Tactile: 25%
Also a kind of stupid quiz. 
I agree that learning styles are not real. They feel like a creation of poor communication from teachers to students. I also agree that some strategies work best for learning things efficiently, with only a few outliers like people with specific needs like dyslexia that would need a different strategy. I also do not feel like an auditory learner. If anything I feel like I would be more of a visual learner, since I usually forget things when they are just told to me.
